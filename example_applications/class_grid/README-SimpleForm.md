# Minimum Viable Forms Application

To run this, install dependencies in the root of the repository with a `npm install`
and then navigate to this folder and run `npm run build` to build the dist files
(which are not checked in).  Then, you should be able to open index.html in the dist
foder from your favorite browser.

This form exercises a configuration-only form that auto-solves when you change Width 
and Height.

Arbitrary precision means you can put some ... big numbers ... into the Width and 
Height.  Have fun!
